### DSA Sheet 1
- **DNABook**: Implements a social network model using an array to manage users and friendships, utilizing binary search for efficiency.
- **FastDNABook**: A variation of DNABook with an increased array size and similar functionality, emphasizing performance improvements.
- **Question2**: Focuses on performance measurement for string repetition operations, comparing naive and optimized approaches.
- **SocialNetwork Interface**: Defines the contract for social network implementations, including user registration and friendship management.
- **StringRepeater**: Provides a method for repeating a string a specified number of times, illustrating basic loop usage.
- **StringStack**: Implements a stack data structure specifically for strings, demonstrating stack operations such as push, pop, and size management.

### DSA Sheet 2
- **DoublyLinkedList**: Introduces a doubly linked list with methods for adding, inserting, and removing elements, including navigation from both ends.
- **LinkedList**: Similar to DoublyLinkedList but for a singly linked list, showcasing fundamental linked list operations.
- **ListNode & ListNode2**: Helper classes for node management within linked lists, storing data and next (and previous for ListNode2) pointers.
- **SkipList**: Presents an implementation of a skip list, a data structure for efficient search, insert, and delete operations.

### DSA Sheet 3
- **AVLTree**: Demonstrates an AVL tree implementation for balanced binary search trees, including rotations for maintaining balance.
- **Sorter**: Contains methods for various sorting algorithms applied to an array of 'Contact' objects, such as selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort, and merge sort.

### Additional Algorithms
- **Interpolation Search**: Implements interpolation search for a list of strings, a variant of binary search that chooses search positions based on estimated locations.
- **Shell Sort**: Applies the shell sort algorithm to an array of doubles, highlighting the efficiency of using gap sequences for sorting.
- **Word Redact**: A Java program for redacting specified words from a block of text, considering incomplete lists of redactable words and using regex for pattern matching.
